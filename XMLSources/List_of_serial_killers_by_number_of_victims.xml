A [[serial killer]] is typically a person who [[murder]]s three or more people, in two or more separate events over a period of time, for primarily psychological reasons.&lt;ref&gt;''Macmillan Encyclopedia of Death and Dying'' entry on [http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_gx5214/is_2003/ai_n19132282 "Serial Killers"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071105174409/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_gx5214/is_2003/ai_n19132282 |date=2007-11-05 }} (2003) by Sandra Burkhalte Chmelir&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Most common"&gt;A serial killer is most commonly defined as a person who kills three or more people for psychological gratification; reliable sources over the years agree. See, for example:
* {{cite web |title=Serial killer| publisher=[[TheFreeDictionary.com]]| accessdate=15 June 2016|url=http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/serial+killer|quote=A person who murders 3+ people over a period of &gt; 30 days, with an inactive period between each murder, and whose motivation for killing is largely based on psychological gratification.}}

The time frame also appears to be an agreed-upon component of the definition.}}
* {{cite book| author = Wayne Petherick|title =Serial Crime: Theoretical and Practical Issues in Behavioral Profiling| publisher = [[Academic Press]] | year = 2005 | page = 190| accessdate = 15 June 2016 |isbn = 978-0-08-046854-9| url =https://books.google.com/books?id=U3-zunZ5eF4C&amp;pg=PA190|quote=Three killings seem to be required in the most popular operational definition of serial killing since they are enough to provide a pattern within the killings without being overly restrictive.}}

* {{cite book| author = Harold Schechter|title = The A to Z Encyclopedia of Serial Killers | publisher = [[Simon and Schuster]] | year = 2012 | page = 73| accessdate = 15 June 2016|isbn = 978-1-4391-3885-4| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=zM7ROzJPK2MC&amp;pg=PA73 |quote= Most experts seem to agree, however, that to qualify as a serial killer, an individual has to slay a minimum of three unrelated victims.}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are gaps of time between the killings, which may range from a few days to months, or many years.&lt;ref name="Most common" /&gt; This list shows serial killers from the 20th century to present day by number of [[Victim of a crime|victims]]. In many cases, the exact number of victims assigned to a serial killer is not known, and even if that person is convicted of a few, there can be the possibility that they killed many more.

Organization and ranking of serial killings is made difficult by the complex nature of serial killers and incomplete knowledge of the full extent of many killers' crimes. To address this, multiple categories have been provided in order to more accurately describe the nature of certain serial murders. This is not a reflection of an individual's overall rank, which may or may not vary depending on personal opinion concerning the nature and circumstances of their crimes. The fourth column in the table states the number of victims definitely assigned to that particular serial killer, and thus the table is in order of that figure. The fifth column states the number of possible victims the killer could have murdered. Some of these crimes are unsolved, but were included because they are the work of a serial killer, despite nobody being caught.

This list does not necessarily include [[war criminal]]s or members of [[democidal]] governments, such as [[Adolf Hitler]], [[Hideki Tojo]], [[Mao Zedong]], [[Joseph Stalin]], or [[Pol Pot]]. 

== Serial killers with the highest known victim count ==
&lt;!-- BEFORE ADDING ANYONE MAKE SURE THAT THEY MEET THE ACTUAL CRITERIA FOR A SERIAL KILLER AND THAT THEY HAVE A WIKIPEDIA ARTICLE ALREADY; IF THEY DO NOT HAVE AN ARTICLE WE CAN ASSUME THEY ARE EITHER NOT NOTEWORTHY OR HAVE NOT BEEN DOCUMENTED WELL ENOUGH TO BE VERIFIABLE. ALL ENTRIES WITH RED LINKS OR NO LINKS WILL BE REMOVED--&gt;
The most prolific modern serial killer is [[Harold Shipman]], with 218 proven murders and possibly as many as 250 ([[#Medical professionals and pseudo-medical professionals|see "Medical professionals", below]]). Excluding these "Medical professionals and pseudo-medical professionals", with their ability to kill simply and in plain sight, and [[#Serial killer groups and couples|Serial killer groups and couples (below)]], this list is a compilation of modern serial killers currently with the highest verifiable murder count.

| 29
| Committed suicide by hanging after murdering his wife and niece. The latter was also decapitated and eviscerated in a manner strongly similar to 26 unsolved murders of women in Florida, starting in 1973, the year Brandt moved to the state. Brandt was later considered the culprit in one of these murders, due to his strong resemblance to a suspect who was filmed by a traffic camera near the place where one body was found. He could not be officially tied to the other crimes due to lack of evidence. Previously, when he was 13 years old in 1971, he attempted to murder his whole family with a gun, for no apparent reason. His mother (who was pregnant) died in this attack, but his father survived, and his sister escaped.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.drphil.com/shows/2188/|title=Charlie Brandt: Killer Child to Serial Killer?
